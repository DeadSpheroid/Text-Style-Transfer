# About this folder
During our learning phase, one of the main sources of information for us was [Andrew NG's Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) available on Coursera.

This folder contains our notes made during the Course for the lectures, specifically Course 1, Course 2, and Course 5.
