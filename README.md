## Aim
The aim of this project is to utilise various neural network architectures to modify the style of a sentence while preserving its meaning.

## Description
Text Style Transfer is the modification of style of a sentence without altering the semantic content. This can be done through a variety of different methods. 

Here we have showcased 4 of the methods that we have tried to apply to solve the given problem.

Namely,
1. Transformer-only
2. StyleFormer
3. DeleteRetrieveGenerate
4. CrossAligned

## Future Prospects
* The usage of finetuned LLMs such as GPT, PaLM, to achieve the desired fluency in Text Style Transfer.
* Potentially use Reinforcement Learning as described [here](https://github.com/luofuli/DualRL/)
